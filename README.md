# Tetris Name
This project is still WIP. The main idea was to make this into a bad UI, where in order for a user to input text into a textbox, they'll need to complete a row in Tetris.
Each block will have a letter on top of it. When a row is completed, it'll input those letters from left -> right. This isn't made to be possible since its kind of hard to
input a username or password by using random letters. Just mostly a joke / bad UI.
