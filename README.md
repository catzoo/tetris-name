# Tetris Name
This project is still WIP. The main idea was to make this into a bad UI, where in order for a user to input text into a textbox, they'll need to complete a row in Tetris.
Each block will have a letter on top of it. When a row is completed, it'll input those letters from left -> right. This isn't made to be possible since its kind of hard to
input a username or password by using random letters. Just mostly a joke / bad UI.

### Controls

| Key | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| Arrow keys | Moves the block (including up) |
| R | Rotates the block |

The controls are still in a debugging phase, which is why you can move the block up. There is also a known bug where if you hold down a button, it will repeatly input. This is a easy fix, just haven't gotten to it yet.
